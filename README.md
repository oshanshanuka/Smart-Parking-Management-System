# Smart Parking Management System

A microservices-based Smart Parking Management System built with Java, Spring Boot, and Maven. The system manages users, vehicles, parking slots, and payments, and uses Eureka for service discovery.

## Features

- **User Service**: Register, update, delete, and retrieve users.
- **Vehicle Service**: Register, update, delete, and retrieve vehicles.
- **Parking Service**: Book, update, delete, and retrieve parking slots.
- **Payment Service**: Validate, update, delete, and retrieve payments.
- **Eureka Server**: Service discovery for all microservices.

## Technologies

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Eureka Server (Netflix OSS)
- Maven
- RESTful APIs

## Architecture

- Each service runs on a different port.
- Eureka Server for service registration and discovery.
- Communication via REST APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
